    "# Introduction\n",
    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are spammy messages?\n",
    "Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we know what are trying to predict. We will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Paso 1. Comprender la información\n",
    "We will be using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository which has a very good collection of datasets for experimental research purposes. The direct data link is here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the data set are currently not named and as you can see, there are 2 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first column takes two values, 'ham' which signifies that the message is not spam, and 'spam' which signifies that the message is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second column is the text content of the SMS message that is being classified."

    "Now that we have a basic understanding of what our dataset looks like, lets convert our labels to binary variables, 0 to represent 'ham'(i.e. not spam) and 1 to represent 'spam' for ease of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why do we need to do this step? The answer to this lies in how scikit-learn handles inputs. Scikit-learn only deals with numerical values and hence if we were to leave our label values as strings, scikit-learn would do the conversion internally(more specifically, the string labels will be cast to unknown float values).\n",

    "Our model would still be able to make predictions if we left our labels as strings but we could have issues later when calculating performance metrics, for example when calculating our precision and recall scores. Hence, to avoid unexpected 'gotchas' later, it is good practice to have our categorical values be fed into our model as integers."
